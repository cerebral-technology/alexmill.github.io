For those of you into [Yo](http://justyo.co), I've recently made a new service called YOFEED. I've been featured on the Yo Index and thought I'd share YOFEED on my blog.

You can visit [http://alex.miller.im/yo/](http://alex.miller.im/yo/) to learn more about YOFEED and subscribe on the Yo app. Essentially, you can use YOFEED to get Yo'd whenever the RSS feed of your choice gets updated. In line with the Yo philosophy, it's a simple service with a simple concept.
