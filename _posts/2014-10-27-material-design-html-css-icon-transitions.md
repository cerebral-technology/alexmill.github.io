Google has done an excellent job documenting and sharing their [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/) specifications. And while they've shared a ton of great resources to mimic Material Design in your own applications, they haven't actually done the coding for you. By no means am I complaining, but I wanted to share some HTML/CSS I've pieced together to mimic what I think is one of Material Design's best "delightful details": icon transitions.
