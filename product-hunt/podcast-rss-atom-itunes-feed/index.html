Podcast discovery has always been a major problem for the platform. This is especially true at the episode level,
where there might be a great interview that you would love, but you never heard about it because you
don't subscribe to that show's feed. That's why I'm a big fan of <a href="producthunt.com/podcasts">Product Hunt's podcast section</a>, where users can submit and
upvote podcasts on an episode by episode basis. I really do think crowdsourcing the best episodes from many different podcasts will
become a big theme as the medium matures. (Just look at <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/show/sampler/">Gimlet's show Sampler</a> as a manifestation of this.)

I've come across a few feeds of PH's podcast submissions, but there was always something I dind't like about them. Product Hunt has a pretty
simple API, so I figured I'd just roll my own ideal version of the podcast feed. Using the links below, you can have the top 1, 3, 5, or 10 
episodes submitted sent to your podcatcher, with the vote count included right in the title and a link to the discussion in the 
episode description. This feed is a work in progress, so feel free to let me know if you have any suggestions for making it better.
You can find me at <a href="https://twitter.com/alexpmil">@alexpmil</a> on Twitter.
